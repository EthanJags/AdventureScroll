# Adventure Scroll
Welcome to the Adventure Scroll! This is a fun and interactive mobile app I built as a personal project using React Native.

## Overview
The purpose of this app is get people to do activities outside of their comfort zone. The app accomplishes this by having users select adventurous activities that they do not know ahead of time, and do them on the spot.

## Features
 - Homescreen has a variety of categories, each filled with tiles that lead to a unique adventurous activity
 - Displays limited info about the activity via emoji's and a title so that users know whether they will be able to do that activity ahead of time
 - Users can upload a photo that will replace the tile on the homescreen as a memoir to their past experiences
 
## What I learned how to do
- use mobile specific components such as:
  - `TouchableOpacity`
  - `SafeAreaView`
  - `ScrollView`
- build complex and beautiful user interfaces
- use a `navigation stack` to navigate between pages
- pass data between pages
- store and retrieve data to `local asynch storage`
- prompt users to enable permissions
- store images from users via their imageUri

## Tools that I used
- React Native
- **Snack,** a React Native Integrated Development Environment
- **Expo** to connect VSCODE to my iPhone for testing
- Tailwind CSS
- Navigation Stack from React-Navigation

## Process
I came up with this idea in high school as something I believe my friends and I would use. This is the process I did to turn it from an idea to an app:
1. Wireframe the user interface on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VpN5ycPoHrDyVaYaOowvMN/The-Adventure-Scroll-Demo-(Copy)?node-id=0%3A1&t=qTFFqSkbmdFQrzWx-1)
2. Build static screens to further test the design
3. Connect screens together using a Stack Navigation Container
4. Make screens interactive and dynamic

Please note that this is a work in progress and the code in this repository represents a prototype.
